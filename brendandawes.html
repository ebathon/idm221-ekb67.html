        <b>Describe your favorite part of the book and define why this section resonates with you?<br></b>
        My favorite Brendon Dawes' Analog In Digital Out was section 3, “Brown Paper Bag and String Moments.” 
        This section emphasizes the idea that good design isn,t necessarily wholly efficient and practical. 
        He uses his customer experience at a local bookstore and deli as examples. Dawes explains that he doesn't
        necessarily need to go to a bookstore to buy a book; he could easily order one online. Still, he goes to the
        store for a tangible experience. Instead of using plastic shopping bags, clerks wrap the books in brown paper
        and string by hand. The same concept applies at the deli, where the cashier wraps the cheese (found practically anywhere)
        in quality paper and string at checkout. Dawes attributes “brown paper bag and string moments” to adding layers that create
        a delightful, interpersonal customer experience. Good design appeals to the human mindset. Since emotions prohibit us from being
        efficient beings, we crave personal experiences and details. In this scenario, the paper and string suggest that what lies
        beneath is of more excellent quality. I resonate with the idea of a unique user journey. Reading this chapter reminded
        me of my own “Brown Paper Bag and String Moments” and will inspire me to consider a multifaceted experience in my future designs. </h3>
        
        <h3 class ="paragraphcontent"><b>Discuss how this book relates to your chosen degree (UXID)?</b><br>
            This book relates to UXID because it teaches design thinking through the lens of a user experience.
            Dawes explains habits and practices he uses in his own life to create a consistent, innovative stream
            of work that pushes the boundaries of possibilities. Everywhere he goes, he carries cameras, adapters,
            cords, USBs, and his computer to capture any information he may need when inspiration strikes. His
            overarching statement throughout the book is, “Why does it have to be like that” (Dawes 10). When
            creating designs in any form, he stresses the importance of asking “how to make something better.”
            Instead of settling for current systems, we should always think about what is possible and how to
            make the user experience more streamlined and intuitive. </h3>

         <h3 class ="paragraphcontent"><b>Describe how you plan to use the lessons in this book during your studies here at Drexel?</b><br>

            The lessons in this book are incredibly applicable to my future studies at Drexel. One of the central 
            points that stood out to me was the emphasis on iteration, referred to by Dawes as “the core of UX.” 
            Iteration is abstract thinking that pushes current boundaries. I was instantly reminded of my Product 
            Design as my Professor emphasizes the need for iterations no matter how stuck we feel in our designs. 
            Iteration has allowed me to create some of my best product ideas. I will make it a consistent part of my 
            future design and brainstorming practice. In addition, the principle of intuition is repeatedly instilled 
            throughout the book, especially when relating to the appeal and ease of minimalism in the user's hands. 
            Lastly, I think the lesson that will be most applicable to my future studies is learning to embrace constraints. 
            Dawes explains that designers often fall into the trap of blaming the software for their shortcomings. Instead, 
            Dawes explains, since constraints are everywhere in UX, from interface responsiveness to client demands, 
            we shouldn't see these constraints as working against our goals and talents but as guides.</h3><br>

    <h5 class ="amtraktext">AMTRAK Mobile App Redesign</h5>
    <h6 class ="amtraktext2">April - June 2022</h6>
    <div class="amtraktext">Overview</div>
    <p class = "amtraktext3">I conducted an in-depth analysis and redesign of Amtrak's
        mobile app flow. The goal was to make the task of booking
        a trip through the app more streamlined and visually appealing.  </p>
        <img class = "img" src="images/Amtrak-Original-IX-Flow.gif">
        <h1 class ="amtraktext"> The Challenge </h1>
        <p class = "amtraktext3"> This project aimed to completely redesign Amtrak’s branding and aesthetic, to create a fresh, vibrant platform for todays users of all ages. The focus was on reworking the app’s flow for booking a trip, defining pain-points, interactions, and how to make them better. </p>
<h1 class ="amtraktext"> User Persona</h1>
        <p class = "amtraktext3">I describe today's typical Amtrak user as a 20-30 something aged
            man named Brian. Brian is a 32-year-old professional living in
            Philadelphia. He doesn't own a car and needs transportation
            to travel up and down the east coast for business and visiting
            family and friends. His main concerns are practicality and
            ease of use. He likes to be comfortable and needs to be able
            to take his work anywhere. <br> He lives in an apartment near
            Rittenhouse Square, frequents the local restaurants and 
            bars for business, and spends time with his friends on 
            the nights and weekends. Since he lives in the city, he
            wants to live as hassle-free as possible, using SEPTA and
            Uber to get where he needs to go. He often utilizes the convenience
            of apps to get the things he needs without taking time away from
            work. For example, he often uses apps like Ubereats, Instacart,
            and GoPuff for food and groceries. </p>

<h1 class ="amtraktext">Pain Points</h1>
<ul class ="amtraktext4">
    <li>Misleading buttons and commands</li>
    <li>Lack of navigation to filter trains</li>
    <li>Pages are cluttered and necessary information is not prominent</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="amtraktext">The Process</h1>
<h5 class="amtraktext2">1. Define IX Flow</h5>
<img class ="img2"src="images/IDM-213-002-ekb67-Amtrak.gif" width="300">
<p class ="amtraktext2">The first task was to define the IX Flow. I examined each
    micro interaction and defined its triggers, feedback, and loops. </p>

<h5 class = "amtraktext3">2. Create Wireframes</h5>
<img class = "img2" src="images/Amtrak Wireframes_for_web.png" width="300">
<p class = "amtraktext2">The second task was to create a series of black-and-white
    wireframes. I wanted to make the process more visually appealing,
    focusing on a train aesthetic, and adding options for users to
    filter trips after the put in their desired dates, departure
    and arrival locations.</p>

    <h3 class ="yikes"> 
        Steve Krug, a Usability Consultant and User Experience Expert wrote "Don't Make Me Think" 
        with a keen purpose at hand: to make UX design principles accessible for those who do not 
        have access to or cannot afford hired professionals like him. In his book, he creates a 
        highly scannable, easily readable format (a principle of design he emphasizes) combined 
        with photos, arrows, illustrations, charts, and comics to allow readers to visualize and 
        interact with the lessons he teaches themselves. His writing style is informal and witty, 
        allowing readers to see themselves in his examples as if the book is written to and for them. 
        Although the book is informative, it is anything but a textbook. Instead, it is an enjoyable, 
        innovative manual for the ever-changing field of User Experience design. </h3>
        <h3 class ="yikes">Throughout the book, Krug lists his go-to universal design principles starting with his first overarching "commandment" 
        of UX is written into the title, "Don't Make Me Think." He expresses the essential nature of 
        intuitive design surrounding the user, emphasizing appropriate naming, making interactive elements 
        obvious, eliminating opportunities for questions, and creating self-explanatory if not "self-evident" 
        navigation. Krug also spends a large portion of the book explaining the need for User Testing in any 
        good web design. No one designer will be able to develop a perfect website by herself. Web design is 
        not a solo endeavor. It takes common sense, so much so that we may overlook the simplest things in the 
        process of trying to make something beautiful. Websites are, in a sense, interactive art. So, the only 
        way a website can hope to be successful is to undergo rigorous user testing starting in the early stages 
        to make the web developer's job as easy as possible when it comes to the inevitable process of making changes.</h3>
        <h3 class ="yikes">When reading the book, a universal concept that surprised me was that even though designing and developing 
        these websites takes an immense amount of thought and time, the audience we create for does not necessarily 
        care about or acknowledge the time that went into creating the site they are navigating. According to Krug, 
        "we don't make optimal choices, we satisfice" (Krug, 24). Users do not look at the site the same way the 
        designers do. Their goal isn't to read everything carefully. Instead, it is to muddle through the site, 
        scanning as little pertinent information as possible, so they can put themselves in a general direction 
        of what they are looking for. Again, referencing the book's title, the main principle is "don't make me 
        (the user) think." Once designers learn to let go of the idea of creative freedom in exchange for universal 
        conventions and patterns, we can create successful, valuable websites. </h3>
        <h3 class ="yikes">One of my favorite parts of the book 
        is Krug's chapter on mobile design. Something intuitive he teaches, yet something I had never been cognizant 
        of, was that when using mobile devices, "people have the ability to move faster and read less" (Krug, 143). 
        This practice encourages mobile-first design; web design created for a mobile screen and later developed for 
        larger desktops. Designing for the small screen allows designers to simplify and optimize websites to their 
        highest capacity, eliminating the risk of confusion and noise for the desktop version.</h3> <h3 class ="yikes"> This book was thoroughly 
        a joy to read, and I recommend it to anyone interested in any human-centered design. Throughout the book, 
        Steve Krug's relatable humor and conversational wittiness makes it palatable to readers of any interest level. 
        It didn't feel like I was reading a textbook, but a fun guide, backed by pictures and graphics, allowing users 
        to test website screenshots on themselves, learning the principles of web design as Krug explains them. Even 
        though it was last revised almost ten years ago, Krug's design principles remain more applicable than ever as 
        he effectively lists the fundamental aspects of user-accommodating design for the web and mobile. The book 
        allows anyone to become a usability consultant, making the principles of intuitive web design accessible to all.</h3>
